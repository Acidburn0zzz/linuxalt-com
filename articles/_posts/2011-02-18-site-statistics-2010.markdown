I decided to take a somewhat deeper look at LinuxAlt’s visitor statistics. I keep daily tabs on the raw 
numbers (visitors and page views), but I never really paid attention to the other statistics that Google’s 
Analytics offers.  

All the following numbers are based on a full year (01/01/2010 to 12/31/2010) selection from my stats 
at Google Analytics.

First, you’ll be happy to know that the number one operating system that visits **The Linux Alternative Project** 
is Linux (56.91%). Windows is a not-so-close second at 38.99% and Mac OS coming in at 2.80%.

Among browsers (unsurprisingly) Firefox is first (65.47%), then Google’s Chrome (17.33%) and Microsoft’s Internet 
Explorer (8.15%) in third. I also wanted to give Opera a shout out here; they made an appearance in 4th at 4.06%.

The most surprising numbers for me are those for mobile devices.  Mobile devices were responsible for just 840 
visits (0.55% of the total traffic) for the entire year.  I’m not sure what I expected but this number seems 
low to me.  Google’s mobile device trend indicator did show an increase in the last 4 months of the year.  So 
a slow start to the year for Mobile Devices could explain the overall low numbers.  I expect the most growth 
in this category in 2011. The stats for this year show iPhone (0.19%) coming in at first and Android (0.17%).
I fully expect Android to be first in 2011.

What does all this mean? Firefox Plugins? Android Apps? Maybe. But right now, pretty much nothing. I’m going 
to keep expanding the site, adding more alternatives and features.

Do you have a Linux related site? If you don’t mind sharing your statistics, please do so in the comments!
