title: Jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon
---

I've been reading about [Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org) over the past few weeks.  Just in the last couple of days, 
I took the plunge and installed the client on my **Linux** box.

The very high level and short description: **Bitcoin** is a peer-to-peer currency system.  

One feature is that it provides anonymity on transactions. This, of course, also opens the door for **bitcoins** to be used for payment of criminal activity, gambling, and other things in that realm.  I'm sure this will be the largest hurtle that **Bitcoin** must overcome to be widely accepted.

I'm looking forward to learning more about **bitcoins**.
