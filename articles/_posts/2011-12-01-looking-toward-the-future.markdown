title: Looking Toward the Future 
---

This site has been around since late 2006.  About 5 years now.

As some of you may have noticed, updates have been sporadic at best.  

The alternatives table (the basis of the entire site) can always be
edited and added to, but there isn't much content otherwise.

I would very much like to change that.

I get a decent number of visitors to this site and I think people find
it useful.  I also want this site grow, but at the same time, I don't
want to mimic the stuff that is already out there.

There are a million Linux blogs, wiki's, and forums out there.  I just
don't know of a niche that needs to be filled.  I'm putting this post
out there to solicit for ideas.  What do you think I should do with this
site?  What would be helpful to Linux users in general?
