Finally!

After working on the new site layout for a few months, it’s ready!  I wanted to keep the site 
simple and clean, while embracing new elements like articles, blogs, podcasts and social media.

Speaking of change, I’m thinking about a changing around the front page.  From the beginning the 
alternatives table has been there, but it’s starting to feel too large.  I’m beginning to think of 
changing the front page to be more of a portal to the rest of the site.  Hopefully this format will be less 
overwhelming.  I do plan on keeping a single page with all the alternatives listed.  It just won’t 
be on the front page.

What do you think? Please let me know in the comments.
