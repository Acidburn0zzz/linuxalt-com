title: Abandoned Linux Projects?
---

Do you have, or know of an abandoned Linux related project?  I'm looking to keep this information around for a long time but I need help finding them.

I can provide hosting for websites that have been long forgotten or neglected.

If you're looking for new maintainer for software you've written, I have a ever growing community and somebody might be interested in taking over.

I'm also looking for projects that are very useful but the maintainers have disappeared.  I like to start a list and possibly even start archiving, if I feel the site in danger of closing down.

Shoot me an e-mail if you know of anything.  contact -at- linuxalt -dot- com
